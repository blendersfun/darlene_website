      Welcome to my writing consultation practice. I provide services to graduate
      students writing master&rsquo;s theses and doctoral dissertations, to professional
      writers in a variety of professions, to English language learners, to
      individuals struggling with writers&rsquo; block, and to those in need of general
      editorial assistence for various writing projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths are in assisting writers with idea clarification and development;
      literature synthesis; integration of critical thinking; as well as organization
      with organization, content, and style. The goals of my consultation services
      are to renew perspective, reduce isolation, and increase writers&rsquo; skills,
      confidience, and productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing <span class="first-letter">C</span>onsults is not a ghostwriting service.
      I neither establish nor maintain formal evaluative roles with students or other
      individuals. My services are strictly voluntary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consultation services are available by appointment. Because the time is reserved
      for you, appointments not cancelled 24 hours in advance will be chared to you,
      except in case of emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I respect your confidentiality and the privacy of the content of your working
      documents. When manuscripts contain sensitive information, I encourage the
      deletion or masking of identifying information whenever possible in advance
      of our meetings. In the event this is not possible, we will seek to focus on
      writing aspects of the task with minimal exposure of sensitive information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to being a partner in thought with you as you writer, and hope
      that you will benefit from your consultation experience.
